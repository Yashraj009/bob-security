# AI Security Linter for VS Code

This extension helps developers write more secure Python code by identifying common vulnerabilities with Semgrep and providing intelligent, one-click fixes using the Google Gemini API.

## Features

- **üõ°Ô∏è Semgrep-Powered Scanning**: Uses custom, high-precision Semgrep rules to detect security issues on file open and save.
- **‚ú® AI-Powered Quick Fixes**: Integrates with the Gemini API to provide intelligent code refactoring suggestions.
- **üîí Secure API Key Storage**: Safely stores your Gemini API key in VS Code's encrypted secret storage.
- **üéØ Targeted Vulnerabilities**:
  - Detects **hardcoded secrets** (API keys, passwords).
  - Flags **missing authorization** checks in Flask routes.

## Prerequisites

1.  **VS Code**: Version 1.80.0 or newer.
2.  **Semgrep**: You must have the Semgrep CLI installed. Follow the [official installation guide](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/installation/).
3.  **Google Gemini API Key**: Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

## Setup & Usage

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd ai-security-linter
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the Extension**:
    - Press `F5` in VS Code to open a new **Extension Development Host** window.
3.  **Set Your API Key**:
    - In the new window, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    - Run the command **"Set Gemini API Key"**.
    - Paste your key and press Enter.
4.  **See it in Action**:
    - Open a Python file with a vulnerability (e.g., `API_KEY = "..."`).
    - A yellow warning underline will appear.
    - Click the lightbulb icon or press `Ctrl+.` (`Cmd+.` on Mac) to see the "‚ú® Fix with AI" option.
